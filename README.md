## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware has experienced rapid growth over the past few years and has now decided to utilize PowerBI for data analytics within the company for the first time. This strategic move aims to outpace their market competitors and enable data-driven decision-making. The project is expected to address stakeholder inquiries across various aspects, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.


I completed this project by following the Codebasics Data Analyst Bootcamp 2.0. The course link is [Link](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance)

## Company profile

AltiQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years, expanding its business operations globally. Specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories, the company operates through three primary channels:
- Retail
- Direct
- Distributorship

Lately, the company incurred an unexpected loss due to the opening of a store in America. This decision was based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Meanwhile, competitors have well-equipped analytics teams to drive their decision-making processes. Consequently, AltiQ Hardware finds it imperative to establish its own analytics team to leverage data-driven insights and make informed decisions to thrive in the industry.

The project initiation meeting aimed at clarifying the project objectives and rationale, and addressing any inquiries pertaining to the project.

### Questions to consider prior to dashboard development:
- What is the primary goal behind constructing this PowerBi dashboard?
- How will we measure the success of this initiative?
- What is the projected timeline for completion?
- Are stakeholders anticipating a preview before the official release?
- What are the stakeholders' aspirations for this project?
- What concerns do stakeholders harbor regarding dashboard development?
- Who will utilize this dashboard and for what purposes?
- What specific outcomes are stakeholders anticipating upon project completion?
- What potential hurdles might we encounter during development?
- What resources/data are necessary for dashboard creation?
- Have stakeholders provided input on dashboard design and visualization preferences?

Following the project initiation meetings, the data engineering team has provided the requested data to the data analytics team. Now, let's delve into them.

### Data Set Familiarization

## Importing data into Power Bi
Since the database for this project is MySQL, we'll need to import the datasets into Power BI by providing the database access credentials.

## Data Model
- Data modeling is essential, serving as the foundation for reports. All visualizations will be constructed based on the data model.
- Inadequate data modeling adversely impacts the overall performance of the report.
- Ensuring adherence to best practices in data modeling is essential. You can explore this blog post to familiarize yourself with these practices: [Link to Blog Post](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices).
- In this project, we've implemented the Snowflake data modeling method.
